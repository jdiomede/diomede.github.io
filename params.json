{"name":"James Diomede | Github","tagline":"","body":"### 4.15.15 | Old Java\r\nPer this well stated answer regarding [the state of Java development for hobbyists](http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-run-a-Java-applet-in-my-browser-by-bypassing-security-checks), I quickly realized it would cost a few extra hops just to run this application that I developed in an era past. I don't stand by the code anymore but I could not argue with how much fun it was to watch this program run, so I have posted a video for those interested.\r\n\r\n[Ball Chamber](https://jdiomede.github.io/ball-chamber) (video)\r\n\r\n### 4.10.15 | Dynamic Collection View\r\nThis is an example of a layout similar to Pinterest that builds on the previous image loading code. The columns can dynamically change, cell attributes scale according to screen width, and cells are aligned in each section.\r\n\r\n[Dynamic Collection View](https://jdiomede.github.io/DCKCollectionView/) (iOS)\r\n\r\n### 3.30.15 | Image Loader\r\nThough there is no substitute for performance testing on an actual (older) device, the team at appetize.io has done some great work with regards to loading iOS applications in a browser for preview. This is a demo of asynchronous image loading in a table view.\r\n\r\n[Image Loader](https://jdiomede.github.io/ILKImageLoader/) (iOS)\r\n\r\n### 3.29.15 | Thanks for stopping by\r\nI am in the process of updating all of my public repos with Github Pages to demonstrate each project. Hopefully this will make it easier to navigate by providing working examples. This is a proof of concept implementation of minesweeper, no templating, stylesheets, or OOD (so why bother right? IDK, it was fun).\r\n\r\n[Minesweeper](https://jdiomede.github.io/minesweeper/) (webpage)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
