The columns can dynamically change, cell attributes scale according to screen width, and cells are aligned in each section.\r\n\r\n[Dynamic Collection View](https://jdiomede.github.io/DCKCollectionView/) (iOS)\r\n\r\n### 3.30.15 | Image Loader\r\nThough there is no substitute for performance testing on an actual (older) device, the team at appetize.io has done some great work with regards to loading iOS applications in a browser for preview.

Hopefully this will make it easier to navigate by providing working examples. This is a proof of concept implementation of minesweeper, no templating, stylesheets, or OOD (so why bother right?
